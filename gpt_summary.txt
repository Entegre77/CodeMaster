GPT-3.5 is a more capable version of GPT-3, a language model developed by OpenAI that is capable of generating human-like text. It was made available in March 2022 with edit and insert capabilities and was trained on data up to June 2021. GPT-3 has been praised for its impressive capabilities but has also been criticized for its potential to spread fake news and facilitate plagiarism. GPT-3.5 includes a browsing feature that allows the model to search the internet for information to include in its responses and was released in alpha for GPT Plus users in April 2023.
