Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the available data consists of labeled examples, and the goal is to learn a function that maps feature vectors to labels based on example input-output pairs. The algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. There are several algorithms available for supervised learning, including support-vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks. The accuracy of the learned function depends on factors such as the type of training examples, the amount of training data available, the dimensionality of the input space, and the degree of noise in the desired output values.
